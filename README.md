# Flutter UI Challenge: 01 Difficulty & Challenge 02

The Flutter UI Challenges! From Low to Pro with the best practices.

## What am I doing?

Flutter UI challenges with best practices. Each repository will increase the difficulty of the UI challenges. Each challenge belongs to a block of difficulty. The first numbers are from the block, while the last numbers are the challenge number.

NOTE!!: For this example I am not using the "themData", I will use it in the next UI that has a theme change. Now in this challenge I am using two theme controlleres using SetState (one in the menu and one in the navBar). I'm just testing the different ways to do it. Obviously the best option is to use the [ThemeData](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/design/themes)
